# Graphs
Directed Graph Structure

Implements the following algorithms:

**Breadth First Search - Iterative**

**Depth First Search - Recursive**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm - Priority Queue**

Uses the following STL containers for implementation:

vector<Edge \*>

map<string, string>

map<string, int>

map<string, Vertex*>

priority_queue<priorityQueuePair, vector<priorityQueuePair>, greater<priorityQueuePair>>
 
queue<Vertex*>

Reads input files from a .txt file that contains the following format:

Number of Edges

Vertex1 Vertex2 Edgeweight

... repeated

Examples of a valid input text files are provided
